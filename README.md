In this repository you'll find some dirt-simple Spring Boot examples that I built as I was learning Spring Boot.

Nothing here is rocket science, and it's not meant to be, it's just my Spring Boot learning experience.

That said, if you're looking for some ridiculously simple example of specific Spring Boot things, it could
be helpful to someone.
